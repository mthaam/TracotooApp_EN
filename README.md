The Tracotoo application is edited by Sébastien Brunet, an independent application developer.

2.    Rules Regarding the Collection and Processing of Personal Data

In accordance with Article 5 of European Regulation 2016/679, personal data must:

- Be processed lawfully, fairly, and transparently to the data subject;
- Be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;
- Be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed;
- Be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. All reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, considering the purposes for which it is processed, is erased or rectified without delay;
- Be kept in a form that permits the identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed;
- Be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the collected data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures.
The processing is only lawful if, and to the extent that, at least one of the following conditions is met:

- The data subject has given consent to the processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes;
- Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
- Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;
- Processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;
- Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
- Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.


3.     Which Users Are Affected by Data Collection?

Data is collected for end users who choose to create an account to save the results of carbon footprint calculations outside of their device. This will allow them to retrieve their data on a different device from the one where the data was entered, for example.

Users who choose not to create an account and save the entered data on their device are also subject to data collection, but only for the purpose of carbon footprint calculations, and this is done anonymously.

End users who use Tracotoo with an account are also subject to data collection for carbon footprint calculations.

For more details on the type of data collected, refer to section 3, 'The personal data that the application collects'.


4.    Personal Data Collected by the Application

For users using the application with an account:

- Email Address
- Password
- IP Address

The registration and login functionality of the application for users with an account uses these data to activate the end user and facilitate the management of the end user's account. These functionalities also use user agent strings to provide additional security and prevent abuse during registration and authentication.
If the user with an account chooses to save the calculation of a trip's carbon footprint, the collected data includes:

- User's identifier
- Addresses and GPS coordinates of departure and destination
- Distance of the trip
- Used vehicle (Make, Model, Year, Engine)

Users with an account who save carbon footprints will also generate summarized carbon footprint data on a remote server, on a monthly and yearly basis, for the months and/or years when the user records trips.

For all users:
To perform carbon footprint calculations, the application will send the following data to a remote server:

- Distance of the trip
- Used vehicle (Make, Model, Year, Engine)

The data collected for carbon footprint calculations is anonymized; therefore, it is impossible to link the end user to the data.

To determine the starting and/or destination address, the application may request and use the user's geolocation access. This information is not used for any other purposes.


5.    How Are Data Collected?

The application does not collect any data automatically for analytical purposes.
The collected data mentioned in section 3, 'The personal data that the application collects', is voluntarily provided by the user when they input it (for example, in a text field or by confirming a choice through a button) and choose to calculate a carbon footprint, register a vehicle, or save a carbon footprint.


6.    Who Are the Recipients of the Data?

The application uses an authentication and registration function for users with an account. For these users, the application may potentially save carbon footprint calculation data on a remote server.
This data is stored solely on secure servers located within the European Economic Area.

The authentication and remote backup services may involve service providers delivering a service with a high level of protection.
The authentication/registration and backup services used have obtained ISO 27001, 27017, 27018, and SOC 1, 2, and 3 certifications.


7. La politique de l’application en matière de cookies et traceurs

The application does not use cookies and trackers.

8.    Data Retention Period

For users with an account, the authentication and/or registration function retains IP address data recorded for a few weeks. Identification data such as email address, password, and username are retained as long as the user keeps their account active, meaning they do not initiate the voluntary process of deleting their account. User agent strings are retained for a maximum duration of 180 days.

The data from carbon footprint calculation results and favorite vehicles, if the user chooses to save them in their account, are retained as long as the user keeps their account active. If the user chooses to delete their account, the deletion of calculation data and vehicles is immediate.
